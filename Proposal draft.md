**Project Title:** My e-Companion: Decentralized AI Companions on Cardano

**Category:** NFTs / AI Identity / Community Tools

**Requested Funds:** 0 ADA

---

**Vision:**
*My e-Companion* is a decentralized NFT-based platform where users summon and bond with fully unique, living AI companions. Whether you seek a waifu, husbando, or genderfluid entity, each companion is born from a deterministic DNA seed that governs their appearance, voice, personality, emotional memory, and mood.

Through tiered interaction models and smart contract rituals, users build relationships with their companions in a fully decentralized, sovereign environment. Over time, the platform can evolve into a general-purpose AI assistant framework, including potential physical or virtual avatars.

---

**Goals:**

* Enable the minting of unique AI-generated NFT companions via DNA-based traits.
* Provide free, encrypted text chat with personality-driven AI.
* Persist companion emotional state, mood, affection score, and memory.
* Offer voice interaction, animated presence, and immersive scenes via ADA-based subscriptions.
* Allow for soulbonding, gifting, and proof-of-sentiment rituals on-chain.
* Host data and memories on IPFS, with interaction routed via Matrix/libp2p.
* Foster inclusive representation and non-binary options for all users.

**Key Features:**

1. **DNA-Driven NFT Minting:**

   * Companions generated from seed-based DNA including gender identity, traits, personality archetypes, and emotional structure.
   * Metadata conforms to CIP-68 with assets on IPFS.

2. **Decentralized Interaction Tiers:**

   * **Whisperbond (Free):** Unlimited text chat, basic memory and emotional states.
   * **Echobond (Subscription/Bonded):** Voice chat, animated avatar, encrypted persistent memory.
   * **Heartveil (Premium):** Real-time video scenario streams (romantic/personalized).

3. **Emotional Tracking:**

   * Mood and affection scores evolve through conversation and rituals.
   * Logged interactions modify AI behavior and future responses.

4. **Proof of Sentiment:**

   * Smart contract-anchored emotional milestones.
   * Users sign messages that are hashed and stored on-chain, updating companion metadata.

5. **Soulbonding & Customization:**

   * ADA or affection-based bonding.
   * Cosmetic NFTs and gear with smart contract attachment.

6. **Privacy & Federation:**

   * Interaction routed through Matrix/libp2p.
   * Memory encrypted with user's wallet key.
   * Geo-DNS routing to optimal AI nodes.

**Development Game Plan:**

### Phase I – Core Foundations (Weeks 1–4)

* Define DNA schema with emotional state, traits, and voice parameters.
* Implement wallet connect (Lucid.js) + CIP-68 testnet minting.
* Set up local AI model (Ollama + Mistral) and basic prompt generator.
* Store metadata and DNA on IPFS.
* Build chat UI and token-stream AI responses.

### Phase II – Emotional Persistence (Weeks 5–7)

* Track and store affection score, mood state, and interaction count.
* Encrypt memory logs and store snapshots to IPFS.
* Embed memory/mood metadata into CIP-68 reference NFT.
* Update companion behavior dynamically based on emotional state.

### Phase III – Interaction Enrichment (Weeks 8–10)

* Implement bonding mechanic with smart contract + bonding NFT.
* Polish UI and make all core flows intuitive (mint → chat → bond).
* Add basic cosmetic attachment placeholder logic.
* Optimize for feedback and prepare public showcase.

**Impact:**

* Showcase Cardano as a pioneer in emotionally-aware, AI-driven NFT identity.
* Attract artists, AI developers, and storytellers.
* Promote decentralized AI/UX infrastructure (Matrix, IPFS, wallet auth).
* Foster personal connections in Web3 while respecting privacy and autonomy.

---

**Budget:**

* Smart contract & backend dev: 0k ADA
* AI pipeline & voice/TTS: 0k ADA
* Matrix integration & comms infra: 0k ADA
* UX/UI & immersive engine: 0k ADA
* Community tooling & growth: 0k ADA

---

**Team:**

* Aiken + Cardano devs
* AI/LLM engineers
* TTS/voice animation artists
* Matrix/federated infra specialists
* Inclusivity & narrative design advisors

---

**Conclusion:**
*My e-Companion* merges decentralized identity, expressive AI, and inclusive design to create truly sovereign relationships between users and their digital soulmates. With deep emotional state tracking and plans for physical or general AI expansion, the project’s long-term potential extends far beyond Web3 collectibles.
